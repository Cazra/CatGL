# CatGL

Another WIP WebGL library.
This will hopefully be a successor to TentaGL and what I started on with KraGL (which never really got far). I guess I could have just tried picking up where I left off with KraGL, but I decided this time I want to start from a clean slate, using some concepts I've been learning from VR development in Unity. We'll see how far I get with this...

This is a test.
